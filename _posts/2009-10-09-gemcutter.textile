I've put all my gems on "gemcutter":http://gemcutter.org/.  They were on "GitHub":http://github.com but seeing as "GitHub has dropped building gems":http://github.com/blog/515-gem-building-is-defunct I thought it'd be useful to move them.

h3. Using gemcutter

The site makes it look easy, because it is:

{% highlight sh %}
gem install gemcutter
gem tumble
{% endhighlight %}

Now you'll be able to install gems from gemcutter.

h3. Publishing your own gems

This is easy too.  Write a gemspec file and then build a gem, and push it to gemcutter:

{% highlight sh %}
gem build yourgem.gemspec
gem push yourgem.gem
{% endhighlight %}

*Note*: It might take a few minutes before the gem is available from gemcutter.

h3. Automation

"Jeweler":http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler can be used to automate this process -- it can use your git and GitHub settings to automatically generate a new project (including GitHub hosting, test directories/helpers).
