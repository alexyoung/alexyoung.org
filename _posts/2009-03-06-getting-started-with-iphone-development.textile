I just published "Getting Started with iPhone Development":http://quiteuseful.co.uk/post/84047428/getting-started-with-iphone-development over at "Quite Useful":http://quiteuseful.co.uk.  It covers the basics and should help you decide if you really want to take the plunge:

* Decide if iPhone development is right for you
* Understand what skills are required
* Learn about what Apple requires from you and how apps are deployed to phones for testing and the iTunes Store
