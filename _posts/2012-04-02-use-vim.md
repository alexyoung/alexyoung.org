[Use Vim](http://usevim.com/) is my new blog all about Vim.  You can follow it on the usual social networks:

* Twitter: [@vimnews](http://twitter.com/#!/vimnews)
* Facebook: [vimnews](https://www.facebook.com/vimnews)
* Google+: [usevim](https://plus.google.com/102329700005777172238)
* Feed: [usevim](http://feeds.feedburner.com/usevim)

I've been collecting interesting Vim-related links for years, so I've wanted to launch a Vim blog for a long time.

The format is similar to [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com/) -- weekly plugin roundups and lots of original content.  I'm currently publishing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

If you've got Vim plugins or tips to share, or would like to write a guest post, [get in touch](http://usevim.com/contact.html).
