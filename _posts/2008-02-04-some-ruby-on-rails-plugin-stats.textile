There are now almost 1000 entries in the main resource for Ruby on Rails plugins, "Agile Web Development's Plugins Directory":http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins.  Of these, 596 have repositories listed that are accessible.  I wanted to see how many of these plugins came with some form of tests, so I created a spider (using a "web spider library":http://rubyforge.org/projects/spider/) and performed some basic analysis on each repository.

After reading a few magazines, and watching two entire TV shows, the spider came back with a result: *54% of the plugins have tests*.

It's amazing to think that there's almost 1000 plugins in one directory, and a good proportion have tests amongst those I could easily analyse.
