Here's an idea I've been playing with today: "Captor":http://github.com/alexyoung/captor/wikis, a GUI for Capistrano management.  It's a very rough prototype right now.

Goals:

* Make running tasks across multiple projects easier
* Interpret the output from Capistrano graphically so it's easier to understand
* Secondary: Provide a wizard-like interface for creating Capistrano files, with recipe management and configuration

Caveats:

* The prototype is messy because I can't get Shoes to load net/ssh (I get openssl errors), so I'm using drb to communicate with cap
* There's no project settings management yet, but that will be easy to add
* The interface isn't cool enough yet
