"Alan Bradburne":http://alanbradburne.com/, a fellow Rails and iPhone developer who I've worked with, has released his first iPhone app: "MoloPix":http://molopix.com/.  It takes multiple photos and combines them into one image, and has an integrated website so you can share them straight from the iPhone.

I wrote a review for it on "Quite Useful":http://quiteuseful.co.uk/post/76738117/review-molopix.
