It didn't take me long, and I knew I wouldn't be able to go for a few hours without writing a basic plugin for <a href="http://google.com/ig">Google Home</a>.

I always wanted to have a del.icio.us search box in a panel with my latest bookmarks, so I wrote this:

<img src='/images/ig_delicious.png' alt='' />

Once you've added it to your homepage, you can enter your delicious username, and it displays your latest links using raw JSON:

{% highlight javascript %}
_IG_FetchContent('http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/' + prefs.getString('username') + '?raw', function (responseText) {
  posts = eval('(' + responseText + ')')
  for (var i=0, post; post = posts[i]; i++) {
     // ... display code here ...
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

All I'm doing is calling _IG_FetchContent(), which the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/homepage/guide.html">API documents</a>, and then building an unordered list of my links.

A search box is displayed by just using a HTML form.

The reason I did this is that I want to extend it in the future so I can do a live search of delicious from Google Home without leaving the page.  I assume this will be quite complex, although I'm hoping I can recycle <a href="http://script.aculo.us">scriptaculous</a> for the most part.

Now I've whet my appetite, however, I'm sure I'll be able to integrate all manner of applications into Google Home.
