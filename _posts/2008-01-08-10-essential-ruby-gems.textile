Despite leaving it for a while, I'm going to continue my previous article, "A taxonomy of Rails plugins", relatively soon.  I've been inspired by the excellent plugins by "errfree":http://errfree.com/ and come up with a few ideas of my own during the heavy workload of 2007.  In particular, I'd like to clarify testing Rails plugins.  But more of that in the near future.

For now, have a look at "10 essential ruby gems":http://blog.helicoid.net/2008/01/08/10-essential-ruby-gems/.  It's hosted on my company's new blog, where you'll eventually find more articles by me with a greater emphasis on web design.
