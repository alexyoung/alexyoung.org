My Rails tutorial (part 1 of 4) has been published in "Linux Format 108":http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=NewArchives&issue=108.  It shows you how to build a Rails-powered photo gallery, by using basic techniques and popular plugins.

Grab it from your favourite newsagent and let me know what you think!
