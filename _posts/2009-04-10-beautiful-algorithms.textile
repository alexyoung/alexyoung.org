I'm starting a new series on Quite Useful called "beautiful algorithms":http://quiteuseful.co.uk/post/94808348/beautiful-algorithms.  I'm going to talk about the algorithms behind graphical effects, especially those from the demo scene back in the 90s.

I've posted some examples to my GitHub account if you want to check out what I've been researching so far.  They use "Ruby Processing":http://wiki.github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing/, which is a pretty accessible way to try out ideas.

* "Fire effect":http://github.com/alexyoung/fire-p5r/tree/master
* "Tunnel effect":http://github.com/alexyoung/tunnel-p5r/tree/master

Please contribute improvements to these and I'll include them.  Imagine what the demo scene would have been like if people shared code on GitHub!
