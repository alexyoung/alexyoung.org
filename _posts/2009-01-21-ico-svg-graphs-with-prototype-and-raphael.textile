I'm making a graph library in JavaScript using "Raphael":http://raphaeljs.com/ called "Ico":http://github.com/alexyoung/ico/tree/master.  I'm targeting Firefox, Safari, IE, Opera and Chrome.  The library isn't just about making graphs though, it's about making readable and useful graphs.

To this end I've taken inspiration and guidance by Stephen Few's books:

* Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten
* Information Dashboard Design

These books effectively boil down Edward Tufte's work as well as other sources into something a programmer like me can follow.

h3. Design goals

My design goals are:

* Clarity: Use of white-space to help lend clarity to graphs, nominal scale vs. ordinal scale
* Simplicity: Minimal use of decorations and lines, reliance on the Gestalt principle of closure
* Conciseness: Avoidance of graph types that don't efficiently present data (pie charts, radar maps)

You won't find any gaudy gradients, unreadable 3D graphs or ambiguous pie charts in this library.  Instead there are lots of small features that improve the readability of data:

* Control "plot padding" around plotted lines/bars (a little bit of lead-in white space can make charts less dense and more readable)
* Add "mean lines" (a single line that displays the mean line of the data)
* Add "acceptable value" backgrounds and highlight values in sparklines: !/images/spark.png!

h3. Plans

I've only been working on this for a week, so it needs loads of attention:

* IE support isn't quite there, Raphael makes this easy but I'm getting font spacing issues right now
* Improve the "zooming" code - Ico tries to zoom into data ranges when starting at 0 doesn't make sense, but this isn't 100% reliable yet
* I might make it framework agnostic (i.e., transparently support Prototype and jQuery.)  I like Prototype's enumerators so I used this initially to make the maths simple
* Find some folks to help with code quality and reuse (I want the library to be able to work packed and I want it as small and fast as possible)

If you want to help contact me on Github and I'll add you as a contributor.  Cheers!
