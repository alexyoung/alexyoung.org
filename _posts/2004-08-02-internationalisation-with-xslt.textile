I've found two approaches to this:

* "Re: internationalization / localization of XSLT output":http://sources.redhat.com/ml/xsl-list/2000-08/msg01318.html
* "An XSLT style sheet and an XML dictionary approach to internationalization":http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-xslt/

I think the second method looks like the best.  I like the idea of using a general XSLT template to add in generic functionality too.
