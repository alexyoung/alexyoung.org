At my company, we've been interviewing people for a web developer position, with particular emphasis on programming.  Something I've noticed is a lot of developers say: "I know JavaScript."  So a simple question I devised for testing this was, "how would you debug JavaScript?"  You'd be surprised how many people don't know the answer to this.

So, if you're a php/perl/python/ruby/asp/etc programmer who "knows" JavaScript, here's a few tools to help with debugging.  These are Firefox extensions.

* <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1584">Hypertext DOM Browser</a>
* <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=216">Venkman</a> - Usually used when all else fails
* <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1843">FireBug</a> - This one is new, I haven't used it much yet
