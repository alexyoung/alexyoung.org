"Track Your Happiness":https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/ is an entertaining experiment.  It's a site that periodically sends out links to surveys.  The surveys are designed to gather information on your general well-being and happiness.  The surveys work fine on iPhones too, so I was able to fill them out wherever I was.

It focuses on a few main areas:

* Activity
* Focus
* Productivity
* Social interactions
* Sleep time and sleep quality

Before taking the tests I had these preconceptions:

* Sleep doesn't bother me
* Productivity and focus are proportional to happiness
* I like working alone
* I prefer reading and playing to working or watching TV

After taking two or three weeks of tests I finally completed the "course" of surveys.  The results were contrary to my assumptions:

* Sleep is strongly tied to my happiness
* Productivity does not relate to my happiness
* I prefer working with at least one person
* Reading and watching TV make me more happy than any other activity
* I'm happier outside

All of these facts surprised me.  When I was a child I'd play outside all the time, but I still had weekend hacking sessions on the ZX Spectrum.  Also, as an entrepreneur and freelancer, I thought productivity made me happy.  It turns out that my workaholic nature has been compromising my overall well-being.

Try signing up and sticking with Track Your Happiness throughout the course of surveys.  They can be annoying and repetitive, but you might be surprised by what you discover.
