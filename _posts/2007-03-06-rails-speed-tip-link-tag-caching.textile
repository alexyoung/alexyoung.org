Have you ever tried concatenating your JavaScript and CSS files for performance improvements?  The idea is that latency is a bigger issue than file size when loading web pages, so stuffing all your JavaScript into a monolithic file for deployment should improve performance.

I wrote a rake task to do this for some of my applications (such as <a href="http://tiktrac.com">tiktrac</a>). This is slightly more cumbersome than a feature I spied in the ActionPack changelog:

<blockquote>
Added caching option to AssetTagHelper#stylesheet_link_tag and 
AssetTagHelper#javascript_include_tag [DHH]. Examples:

{% highlight ruby %}
stylesheet_link_tag :all, :cache => true # when ActionController::Base.perform_caching is false =>
stylesheet_link_tag :all, :cache => true # when ActionController::Base.perform_caching is true =>
{% endhighlight %}

...when caching is on, all.css is the concatenation of style1.css, styleB.css,
and styleX2.css.  Same deal for JavaScripts.
